# Task Management Application for TeachMateAI

This is a react application created with REACT, redux for state management. It displays tasks based on statuses. I chose such design because it logically groups tasks based on the status of the tasks and also allows for inclusion of features in the future.

## How to run the application

 - clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Brian-Machiestay/task-dashboard`
 - `cd task-dashboard`
 - `npm start`
 - If you want the static files, `npm run build` and serve from the build folder
